                             Hi, I am really upset I am not doing good in my career.                                                                      what is your career?
I am an engineer and I am currently pursuing my Masters, but my grades are not good.                                                                what are your grades like?
                                 I am getting less than 8 GPA. How do I handle this?                                                                    are you studying hard?
                                     No I am a bit distracted due to family illness.                                                                are you taking any breaks?
                      No my semester is running and I dont have time for any breaks.                                                                             i understand.
       I am feeling low because of this situation. Kindly suggest how I handle this.                                                                  i am sorry to hear that.
                               What can I possibly do to come out of this situation. you can try to take some time off from work and spend some quality time with your family.
                                                    Sure! Thanks for the suggestion!                                                                          you are welcome!
