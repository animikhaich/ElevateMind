                             Hi, I am really upset I am not doing good in my career.                                                         what's wrong?
I am an engineer and I am currently pursuing my Masters, but my grades are not good.                                        what's wrong with your career?
                                 I am getting less than 8 GPA. How do I handle this?                                   you need to talk to your professor.
                                        I am a bit distracted due to family illness.                                        what's wrong with your family?
                    My semester is running and I dont have time for any breaks also.                                 i understand. i'm sorry to hear that.
       I am feeling low because of this situation. Kindly suggest how I handle this. i understand your situation. you need to take care of yourself first.
                               What can I possibly do to come out of this situation.                    you can try to take a break from work for a while.
                                            Anything else you would like to suggest?                              no, i think you have covered everything.
                                                    Sure! Thanks for the suggestion!                                                       you're welcome!
